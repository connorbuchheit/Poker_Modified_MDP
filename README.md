# Poker_Modified_MDP
This is our final project for CS1840. 

Simple_game_numeric contrains our fully-solved simple game.

Simple_game.py contains the simulation, and simple_game_Q_learning contains the Q_learning part that finds a good solution.

Texas_hold_em_final.py contains the simplified version of texas hold-em, with the associated Q-learning files solving a policy.

Check out the folder "deep_Q_learning" for all of the code pertaining to our Q-Neural network. "Texas_hold_em_complex.py" contains the game simulation and reward functions, "train_dql.py" is how you train a network, evaluate.py is how you run the trained network (there is a trained network in the folder that will work as it).
